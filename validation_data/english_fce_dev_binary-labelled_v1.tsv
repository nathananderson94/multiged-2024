22	finishing	c
23	I	c
24	put	c
25	them	c
26	back	c
27	nicely	c

1	The	c
2	reason	c
3	I	c
4	enjoyed	c
5	it	c
6	very	c
7	much	c
8	is	c
9	that	c
10	I	c

2	was	c
3	absolutely	c
4	fantastic	c
5	.	c

1	I	c
2	had	c
3	ever	c
4	never	c
5	sit	i
6	down	c
7	there	c
8	.	c

1	Additionally	c
2	,	c
3	you	c
4	could	i
5	n't	c
6	believe	c
7	,	i
8	but	c
9	the	c
10	vocalist	c
11	said	c
12	\"	c
13	All	c
14	the	c
15	chairs	c
16	you	c
17	are	c
18	sitting	c
19	down	NA
20	were	i
21	set	c

1	At	c
2	first	c
3	it	c

7	time	c
8	and	c
9	the	c
10	musical	c
11	show	NA
12	started	c
13	later	c
14	than	c
15	I	c
16	expected	c
17	so	c
18	I	c
19	was	c
20	getting	c
21	nervous	i
22	because	c
23	I	c
24	dislike	i
25	very	i
26	much	i
27	the	NA
28	impuntuality	i
29	,	c

16	he	i
17	seemed	i
18	not	i
19	to	c
20	be	c
21	an	c
22	actor	c
23	.	c

1	Really	c
2	he	c
3	was	c
4	bad	c
5	.	c

1	Afterwards	c
2	I	c
3	decided	c
4	to	c
5	go	c
6	for	c
7	a	c
8	meal	c
9	in	c
10	the	c
11	theatre	c

9	.	c

1	You	c
2	wanted	c
3	to	c
4	cheat	c

8	I	c
9	will	c
10	be	c
11	very	c
12	pleasure	i
13	if	c
14	you	c
15	could	c
16	give	c
17	my	c
18	money	c
19	back	c
20	.	c

1	I	c
2	am	c
3	looking	c
4	forward	c
5	your	i
6	answer	c
7	.	c

1	Your	i
2	faithfully	c
3	,	c

1	I	c
2	think	c
3	technology	c
4	has	c
5	changed	c
6	my	c
7	life	c
8	and	c
9	the	c
10	way	c
11	of	c
12	living	i
13	of	c
14	almost	c
15	all	i
16	people	i
17	around	c
18	the	c
19	world	c
20	.	c

1	First	c
2	of	c
3	all	c
4	technology	c
5	is	c
6	very	c
7	useful	c
8	nowadays	c
9	but	c
10	really	c
11	I	c
12	dislike	c
13	it	c
14	because	c
15	in	c
16	some	c
17	ways	c
18	we	c
19	are	c
20	becoming	c
21	machines	c
22	too	c
23	.	c

1	Since	c
2	the	c
3	creation	c
4	of	c
5	PCs	c
6	,	c
7	people	c
8	-	c
9	and	c
10	me	c
11	too	c
12	,	c
13	of	c
14	course	c
15	-	c
16	are	i
17	making	i
18	different	c
19	things	c
20	.	c

1	For	c
2	example	c
3	we	c
4	can	c
5	buy	c
6	food	c
7	,	c
8	clothes	c
9	and	c
10	whatever	c
11	we	c
12	need	c
13	by	c
14	internet	i
15	or	c
16	by	c
17	telephone	c
18	.	c

1	I	c
2	can	c
3	know	i
4	what	c
5	is	c
6	happening	c
7	in	c
8	differents	i
9	parts	c

11	the	c
12	world	c
13	in	c
14	a	c
15	few	c
16	minutes	c
17	.	c

1	A	c
2	very	c
3	good	c
4	point	i
5	of	c
6	this	c
7	change	c
8	is	c
9	that	c
10	women	c
11	have	c
12	more	c
13	freedom	c
14	to	c
15	have	i
16	a	i
17	job	i
18	because	c
19	before	c
20	reaching	i
21	the	c
22	technology	c
23	they	c
24	have	i
25	to	c
26	stay	c
27	at	c
28	home	c
29	doing	c
30	housework	c
31	but	c
32	now	c
33	we	c
34	have	c
35	laundries	c
36	and	c
37	a	c
38	lot	c
39	of	c
40	machines	c
41	like	c
42	microwave	c
43	oven	i
44	.	c

1	In	i
2	my	i
3	case	i
4	I	c
5	dislike	c
6	computers	c
7	.	c

1	I	c
2	do	c
3	n't	c
4	know	c
5	how	c
6	to	c
7	use	c
8	them	c
9	but	c
10	I	c
11	know	c
12	I	c
13	have	c
14	to	c
15	change	c
16	because	c
17	they	c
18	help	c
19	us	NA
20	to	c
21	make	c
22	our	c
23	lives	c
24	easier	c
25	.	c

1	On	c
2	the	c
3	other	c
4	hand	c
5	what	c
6	will	c
7	happen	c
8	with	i
9	us	c
10	in	c
11	the	c
12	future	c
13	?	c

1	Our	c
2	life	i
3	will	c
4	be	c
5	managed	c

11	replace	c
12	us	c
13	in	i
14	our	i
15	jobs	i
16	.	c

1	So	c
2	,	c
3	what	c
4	are	c
5	we	c
6	going	c
7	to	c
8	do	c
9	?	c

1	Something	c
2	that	c
3	I	c
4	note	c
5	about	c

16	the	c
17	weekend	c
18	ticket	c

1	To	c

12	a	c
13	good	c
14	idea	c
15	for	c
16	next	c
17	year	c
18	.	c

1	In	c
2	my	c
3	opinion	c
4	it	c
5	would	c
6	be	c
7	nice	c
8	if	c
9	you	c
10	create	i
11	an	c

3	you	c
4	earn	c
5	money	c
6	in	c
7	your	c
8	spare	c
9	time	c
10	?	c

1	I	c
2	think	c
3	everybody	c
4	will	c
5	ask	c
6	himself	c
7	this	c
8	question	c
9	one	c
10	day	c

12	has	c
13	already	c
14	asked	c
15	it	c
16	.	c

1	Anyway	c
2	the	c
3	people	c
4	where	i
5	asked	c
6	this	c
7	question	c
8	probably	c
9	found	c
10	out	c
11	that	c
12	it	c
13	is	c
14	n't	c
15	so	c
16	easy	c
17	to	c
18	earn	c
19	money	c
20	or	c
21	that	c
22	it	c
23	is	c
24	sometimes	c
25	to	i
26	much	c
27	work	c
28	.	c

1	A	c
2	traditional	c
3	way	c
4	to	c
5	earn	c
6	money	c
7	,	c
8	in	c
9	the	i
10	spare	c
11	time	c
12	,	c
13	is	c
14	to	c

1	The	c

3	that	c
4	you	c

6	here	c
7	is	c
8	the	c

1	For	c
2	example	c
3	when	c

7	,	c
8	because	c
9	then	c
10	everything	c
11	get	i
12	wet	c
13	.	c

1	Another	c
2	suggestion	c
3	is	c
4	that	c
5	you	c
6	go	c
7	to	c
8	your	c
9	cinema	c
10	and	c
11	ask	c
12	if	c

1	But	c
2	in	c
3	the	c
4	case	c
5	that	c
6	you	c
7	really	c
8	want	c

1	I	c
2	think	c
3	this	c

5	is	c
6	a	c
7	great	c
8	idea	c

7	working	c
8	in	i
9	a	c
10	concert	c
11	was	c
12	great	c
13	.	c

1	You	c
2	ca	c

33	who	c
34	organize	c
35	the	c
36	security	c
37	service	NA
38	...	c
39	it	c
40	was	c
41	so	c
42	exciting	c
43	!	c

1	My	c
2	work	c
3	consisted	c
4	in	c

14	taking	c
15	the	NA
16	people	c
17	to	c
18	their	c
19	seats	c
20	.	c

1	It	c
2	was	c
3	also	c
4	very	c
5	tiring	c
6	because	c
7	all	c
8	the	c
9	people	c
10	arrived	c

13	same	c
14	time	c

39	so	c
40	much	c
41	noise	c
42	.	c

1	Sometimes	c

19	they	c
20	would	c
21	have	c
22	made	c
23	less	c

15	.	c

1	Especially	c
2	to	c

3	a	c
4	great	c
5	opportunity	c
6	to	c
7	learn	c

12	more	c
13	countries	c

9	popular	c
10	.	c

5	classical	c
6	concerts	c
7	are	c
8	amazing	c
9	,	c
10	but	c
11	I	c
12	think	c

15	concert	c
16	halls	c
17	are	c
18	too	c
19	small	c

5	me	c
6	in	c
7	it	c
8	is	c
9	very	c
10	original	c
11	too	c
12	.	c

1	I	c
2	must	c
3	say	c
4	that	c
5	rules	i
6	are	c
7	n't	c
8	same	i
9	in	c
10	schools	i
11	of	c
12	our	c
13	country	c
14	.	c

1	Every	c
2	school	c
3	has	c
4	it	i
5	's	i
6	own	c
7	rules	c
8	.	c

1	I	c
2	think	c
3	that	c
4	my	c
5	school	c
6	is	c
7	very	c
8	democratic	c
9	and	c
10	so	c
11	there	c
12	are	c
13	very	c
14	good	c
15	relations	c
16	between	c
17	teachers	c
18	and	c
19	students	c
20	.	c

1	We	c
2	are	c
3	all	c
4	very	c
5	friendly	c
6	in	c
7	our	c
8	class	c
9	and	c
10	we	c
11	help	c

14	other	c
15	when	c
16	we	c
17	have	c
18	a	c
19	problem	c
20	.	c

1	So	c
2	the	c
3	main	c
4	rule	c
5	in	c
6	our	c
7	school	c
8	is	c
9	regarding	c
10	theachers	i
11	.	c

1	I	c
2	'm	c
3	allowed	c
4	to	c
5	do	c
6	many	c
7	things	c
8	at	c
9	home	c
10	.	c

1	My	c
2	parents	c
3	are	c
4	very	c
5	kind	c
6	,	c
7	and	c
8	they	c
9	know	c
10	that	c
11	their	c
12	son	c
13	will	c
14	do	c
15	everything	c
16	right	c
17	.	c

1	And	c
2	the	c
3	main	c
4	reason	c
5	Why	i
6	our	c
7	family	c
8	is	c
9	so	c
10	friendly	c
11	,	NA
12	it	i
13	's	i
14	because	c
15	we	c
16	haven't	c
17	go	i
18	many	c
19	rules	c
20	.	c

1	So	c

1	You	c
2	had	c
3	to	c
4	be	c
5	disappointed	c
6	.	c

1	There	c
2	is	i
3	a	c
4	lot	c
5	of	c
6	situations	c
7	which	c
8	could	c
9	make	c
10	you	c
11	feel	c
12	similar	c
13	while	c
14	you	c
15	do	c
16	shopping	c
17	.	c

1	You	c
2	might	c
3	spend	c
4	too	c
5	much	c
6	money	c
7	and	c
8	buy	c
9	something	c
10	you	c
11	do	c
12	n't	c

1	You	c
2	could	c
3	also	c
4	buy	c
5	something	c
6	which	c
7	later	c
8	turns	c

13	of	i
14	order	i
15	.	c

1	So	c
2	you	c
3	have	c
4	to	c
5	complain	c
6	about	c
7	it	c
8	.	c

1	Very	c
2	often	c
3	a	c
4	shop	c
5	assistant	c
6	is	c
7	not	c
8	helpful	c
9	so	c
10	you	c

12	your	c
13	money	c
14	and	c
15	your	c

11	drunk	c
12	shop	c
13	assistant	c
14	or	c
15	manager	c

1	This	c
2	leads	c
3	to	c
4	an	c
5	escalation	c
6	of	c
7	your	c
8	anger	c
9	.	c

1	Sometimes	c
2	you	c
3	could	c
4	find	c

1	But	c
2	at	c
3	home	c
4	you	c
5	noticed	i
6	that	c
7	there	c
8	is	c
9	a	c
10	tear	c
11	on	c
12	sleeve	i
13	.	c

1	And	c
2	you	c
3	could	c
4	n't	c
5	of	c
6	course	c
7	give	i
8	it	c
9	back	c
10	because	c
11	the	c
12	price	c
13	was	c
14	lowered	c
15	and	c
16	your	c
17	dress	c
18	is	c
19	not	c
20	under	c
21	guarantee	c
22	.	c

1	You	c
2	could	c
3	also	c
4	face	c
5	an	c
6	unpleasant	c
7	situation	c
8	connected	c

1	First	c
2	of	c
3	all	c

53	,	c
54	but	c
55	I	c
56	thought	c
57	completely	c
58	wrong	c
59	!	c

1	Firstly	c
2	,	c
3	the	c
4	play	c
5	started	c
6	nearly	c
7	an	c
8	hour	c
9	later	c
10	as	i

1	If	c
2	the	c
3	spectacle	i

5	been	c
6	beautiful	c
7	,	c
8	I	c
9	would	c

11	I	c
12	would	c
