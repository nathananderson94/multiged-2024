there	c
are	c

last	c

not	c
the	c

argument	c
is	c
that	c

it	c

there	c
is	c
no	c

but	c
to	c
my	c
opinion	c
we	c
should	c
concentrate	c
on	c
our	c
own	c

because	c

is	c
one	c
of	c

is	c

that	c

think	c
that	c

find	c

they	c

not	c
with	c

it	c
is	c
indeed	c
beneficial	c

because	c

this	c

if	c
the	c

they	c
can	c

those	c

my	c
point	c

something	c
we	c

nowadays	c

many	c

want	c
to	c

there	c
is	c
a	c
possibility	c
that	c
we	c
will	c
not	c
have	c
enough	c
people	c
who	c
do	c
this	c

the	c
countries	c
of	c

level	c
of	c

conditions	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
highest	c
in	c
the	c

I	c
believe	c
this	c

the	i

the	c

there	c
are	c

there	c
are	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
such	c

it	c
could	c

reason	c
why	c

the	c

reasons	c
why	c

say	c
that	c

that	c

one	c
of	c
the	c
ways	c

one	c

it	c
is	c

that	c

think	c
that	c

conclusion	c

i	c
fully	c
disagree	c
that	c

not	c
omportant	i
nowadays	c
because	c
humanity	c
can	c
lose	c
lots	c

can	c
be	c
concluded	c
that	c
the	c
amount	c
of	c

doing	c

had	c
risen	c
from	c

to	c

,	c
I	c
agree	c
that	c
it	c
makes	c

there	c
are	c
also	c
some	c
drawbacks	c

try	c
to	c
solve	c
global	c
problems	c
together	c
.	c

's	c
obvious	c
that	c
the	c
main	c
argument	c
for	c
decreasing	c
the	c
number	c
of	c
languages	c
is	c
that	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
easier	c
to	c
communicate	c
with	c
people	c
from	c
other	c
countries	c
whose	c
national	c

if	c
we	c
take	c
other	c
national	c
languages	c
,	c
of	c
other	c
countries	c
,	c
we	c
are	c
more	c
likely	c
to	c
understand	c

second	c
problem	c
is	c
that	c

if	c
some	c
person	c
wanted	c
to	c
know	c

it	c

take	c

there	c

no	c
guarantees	c
his	c
memory	c
would	c

my	c
opinion	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
much	c
better	c

easier	c

there	c
were	c
less	i

it	c

my	c
opinion	c

in	c
that	c
case	c

all	c

believe	c
that	c

It	c

that	c

if	c

in	c
my	c
opinion	c

at	c
the	c

time	c
this	c
may	c
dangerous	c
for	c

in	c
my	c

it	c
makes	c
people	c
to	c

that	c

education	c
should	c
be	c
available	c
to	c
everyoune	i
for	c

reason	c
of	c
it	c
is	c
that	c
they	c

the	c

fisrt	c
and	c
the	c

in	c

the	c

we	c

the	i

education	c
should	c
be	c

because	c

to	c

first	c
reason	c
why	c

other	c
hand	c

a	c

it	c

also	c

at	c
the	c

I	c
am	c
convinced	c
that	c

this	c

believed	c
by	c

to	c

that	c

major	c
argument	c
is	c
that	c

of	c

is	c
linked	c

the	c
quality	c
of	c
life	c

some	c

assume	c

it	c
should	c

who	c

for	c

those	c
who	c

that	c

The	c
first	c
reason	c
why	c
i	i
disagree	c
with	c

that	c

problem	c
is	c
-	c
people	c
would	c
still	c
know	c
about	c
these	c

they	c
may	c

the	c
most	c

for	c
my	c

I	c
see	c
the	c
solution	c
of	c

in	c

that	c
the	i

many	c

conclude	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
two	c
points	c
:	c
the	c
first	c
one	c
is	c
that	c
medicine	c
is	c
a	i
richest	i
field	i
of	c
all	c
in	c
modern	c
days	c
and	c
the	c
second	c
one	c
is	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
too	c
rich	c
for	c
people	c
who	c
do	c
not	c
have	c
enough	c
money	c
to	c
leave	c
without	c

if	c
we	c
sill	c
try	c
to	c
imagine	c
such	c
company	i
that	c
would	c
produce	c
cheaper	c
medicine	c
,	c
it	c
will	c
immidiately	i

the	c
problem	c
of	c
possible	c

,	c
we	c
should	c
not	c
force	c
pharmaceutical	c
industry	c
to	c
become	c
extremely	c
altruistic	c
as	c
far	c
as	c
it	c
may	c
lead	c
to	c

is	c
the	c

control	c

the	c

a	c
very	c
large	c

there	c
is	c
one	c
similarity	c
-	c
the	c
amount	c
of	c

is	c
also	c
noticeable	c
that	c
the	c

there	c
is	c
an	c
opinion	c
that	c

should	c

to	c

I	c
can	c
partly	c
agree	c
with	c
this	c
opinion	c

example	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
such	c
medicines	c
that	c
are	c
not	c
difficult	c
to	c
produce	c

therefore	c
their	c
prices	c
can	c
be	c
cheaper	c

sum	c
up	c
everything	c
mentioned	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
we	c
live	c
in	c
a	c
capitalistic	c
world	c
and	c
money	c
does	c
mean	c
a	c
lot	c

,	c
in	c
Indonesia	c
,	c
the	c
number	c
of	c
people	c
emplyed	i
in	c

is	c
significantly	c
higher	c

help	c
them	c

,	c
the	c
number	c
of	c
women	c
in	c

did	c
not	c
exceed	c
of	c

can	c
buy	c
basic	c

when	c
they	c

conclude	c
,	c
pharmaceutical	c
companies	c
should	c
help	c
people	c
and	c
provide	c
them	c
with	c
medicine	c
,	c
but	c
also	c
we	c
should	c
remember	c
that	c
these	c
companies	c
are	c
part	c
of	c
the	c
business	c
and	c
the	c
owners	c
of	c

can	c
eixist	i

it	c
can	c
help	c

to	c

but	c
I	c
consider	c
that	c
this	c
is	c
not	c
easy	c
to	c

to	c

is	c
why	c

who	c

will	c

agree	c
to	c
spend	c

ammount	i

that	c

On	c
the	c

these	c

have	c
a	c
reason	c
to	c
make	c
the	c
price	c

,	c
it	c
is	c
because	c
of	c
the	c

In	c
conclusion	c

I	c
want	c
to	c
emphasise	c

that	c

to	c
the	c

a	c
belief	c

that	c

to	c

\"	c

\"	c

its	c

,	c
I	c
believe	c
in	c
a	i
free	i
-	i
market	i

and	c
oppose	c
governmental	c
interference	c
in	c
the	c
economy	c
,	c
but	c
the	c
reality	c
with	c
pharmaceutical	c
companies	c
brings	c
me	c
to	c
a	i
conclusion	i
that	c
a	c
certain	c
types	c
of	c
restrictions	c
on	c
their	c
business	c
should	c
exist	c
,	c
because	c
the	c
point	c
of	c
existance	c
of	c
such	c
companies	c
is	c
to	c
help	c
people	c
survive	c
.	c

first	c
argument	c
is	c
an	i
idea	i
that	c
many	c
senior	c
citizens	c
or	c
people	c
with	c
pre	c
-	c
existing	c
conditions	c
are	c
the	c
most	c
vulnurable	i
social	c
group	c
without	c
an	c
ability	c
to	c
be	c
efficient	c
workers	c
in	c
many	c
situations	c
,	c
but	c
at	c
the	c
same	c
time	c
they	c
are	c
the	c
ones	c
in	c
need	c
.	c

giants	c
constantly	c
raise	c
prices	c
for	c
essential	c
medicines	c
and	c
many	c
people	c
fail	c
to	c
buy	c
required	c
drugs	c
to	c
sustain	c
normal	c
lives	c
.	c

the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
understandable	c
that	c
producing	c
and	c
researching	c
new	c
medicine	c
is	c
extremely	c
costly	c
for	c
producers	c
,	c
what	c
can	c
cause	c
so	c
high	c
prices	c
for	c
drugs	c
.	c

,	c
their	c
drugs	c
and	c
others	c
products	c
can	c
frequently	c
be	c

from	c
the	c

give	c
companies	c
to	c
invest	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
resources	c
into	c
research	c
.	c

profits	c
are	c
high	c

more	c
companies	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
enter	c
the	c
market	c

the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
the	c
pharmaceutical	c
market	c
is	c
not	c
really	c
competitive	c
.	c

example	c
,	c
many	c
pharmaceutical	c
companies	c
in	c
USA	i
spend	c
huge	i
part	i
of	c
their	c
budget	c
to	c
make	c
their	c
brand	c
more	c
attracting	c
.	c

,	c
if	c
they	c
would	c
n't	c
work	c
in	c
such	c
way	c
and	c
cancel	c
these	c
activities	c
,	c
it	c
will	c
become	c
easier	c
to	c
make	c
medicals	c
cheaper	c
.	c

,	c
many	c
people	c
say	c
that	c
the	c
aim	c
of	c
pharmaceutical	c
companies	c
should	c
be	c
to	c
produce	c
cheaper	c
medicine	c
and	c
help	c

not	c
to	c
make	c

on	i

increasing	c
